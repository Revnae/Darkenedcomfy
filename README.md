### ‚ùó Important
This is my first discord theme. I‚Äôm still "new" to all this CSS stuff; I only jumped into it late last year and have slowly been changing my theme over the past few months. I gradually got more comfortable with CSS and updated + fixed my theme for public use/testing.
---
The people in the screenshots are not me, and I've blurred stuff as I don't want friends to get spammed and or added. moreover, I'd prefer it if people didn't know what server(s) I'm in for obvious reasons, and I'm a relatively private person cause I am clapped.
---
I'll update this as often as I can; however, I do not use canary version of discord, so the updates may take a while to push if they change containers etc. on that note, I hope you enjoy the theme, and if you encounter any issues, bugs or want me to attempt to add support for a plugin you use, please tell me.
