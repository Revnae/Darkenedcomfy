### ‚ùó Important
I'll update this as often as I can; however, I do not use canary version of discord, so the updates may take a while to push if they change containers etc.
This is my first discord theme. I‚Äôm still "new" to all this CSS stuff; I only jumped into it late last year and have slowly been changing my theme over the past few months. I gradually got more comfortable with CSS and updated + fixed my theme for public use/testing. Enjoy.

### ‚ÑπÔ∏è Credits
