### ‚úç Summarization
This is my first discord theme. I‚Äôm still "new" to all this CSS stuff; I only jumped into it late last year and have slowly been changing my theme over the past few months. I gradually got more comfortable with CSS and updated + fixed my theme for public use/testing. Nyria's themes gave me a lot of inspiration, and you'll 100% see what I mean if you use this.
---
The people in the screenshots are not me, and I've blurred stuff as I don't want friends to get spammed and or added. moreover, I'd prefer it if people didn't know what server(s) I'm in for obvious reasons, and I'm a relatively private person cause I am clapped.
---
I'll update this as often as I can; however, I do not use canary version of discord, nor am I some mastermind that can instantly fix/add stuff, so the updates may take a while to push if they change containers etc. on that note, I hope you enjoy the theme, and if you encounter any issues, bugs or want me to attempt to add support for a plugin you use, please tell me. Trying to learn basic CSS by making random stuff.

‚Üí In the appearance settings make sure Dark is selected or it'll look like someone dropkicked discord.
